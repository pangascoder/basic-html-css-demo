            <p>Lovopoly is a spin-off of the popular board game Monopoly. Instead of trying to monopolize properties and get rich, the aim of the game is to show love, love, love. It's about your treasured belongings, special places and acts of kindness.</p>
            <p>The game is usually custom-made from a shop, but you have the freedom to create your own at home and personalised it for your loved ones.</p>
            <p>Most of the examples you'll find in the internet are aimed towards couples, but your game doesn't have to be. You could create a game with your family or friends.</p>
            <p>All you need are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cardboard</li>
                <li>Paper (preferrably hard paper such as card stock)</li>
                <li>Colour paper (for artistic touch)</li>
                <li>Markers</li>
                <li>Dice</li>
                <li>Tokens (for your characters)</li>
                <li>Imagination</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you don't feel artsy, you can also order a personalised Monopoly board game and customise your board and cards.</p>
